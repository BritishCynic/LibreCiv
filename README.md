# LibreCiv
LibreCiv is an open-source reimplementation of Sid Meier's Civilization

My intent for this project is to showcase my growing ability to code in C++ as I learn more about the language. As of this moment, I can only do console applications, so this app won't do much at first, but I do intend to have it functional eventually as an ongoing self-development project. I believe very strongly in maintaining coding standards throughout my code, and ensuring that code is both human-readable and functional. I do have a number of things that I want this project to adhere to:

1) I do want to start a version history from the first moment I start the project, so I do aim to release regular tags of versions to showcase what I think are suitable milestones in development. I intend to use Semantic Versioning on a Major.Minor.Patch version system while adhering to the tenents of development found at https://semver.org/.
2) I fully embrace the open-source software movement, and I believe that my code should be published and freely available. To that end, I intend to license my code under the GNU General Public License version 3.
3) This is a project intended to focus and channel my growing ability as a C++ developer, so updates will be as rapid as I deem fit.
4) A Changelog file will be updated by me before every tagged version to provide a text-based overview of changes that I believe are important enough to highlight. This file will contain all changes dating back to the initial release.
5) A Project file is included to present my general plan for this software project as a roadmap of sorts for development.
